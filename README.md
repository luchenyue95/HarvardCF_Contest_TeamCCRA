Harvard IACS Computefest 2017 data visualization contest

TeamCCRA: Chenyue Lu and Linda Nieman, Massachusettes General Hospital Cancer Center 

"The idea here is to do exploratory visualization in preparation for data analysis. The dataset we will use is from the UCI machine learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype . The dataset contains cartographic variables that might be useful in predicting the kind of tree cover. Your visualizations should be useful to an analyst in creating machine learning models to analyze this dataset: you are looking for correlations between the "features" and the kind of tree cover."
